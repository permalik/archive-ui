### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every positive integer (save the number 1) can
be represented in exactly one way apart from rearrangement as a product of one or more primes
(Hardy and Wright 1979, pp. 2-3).

This theorem is also called the unique factorization theorem. The fundamental theorem of
arithmetic is a corollary of the first of Euclid's theorems (Hardy and Wright 1979).
